\section{Overview}

Consider following example:

\begin{verbatim}
my_member(E, [E|_]).
my_member(E, [_|T]) :-
    my_member(E, T).
\end{verbatim}

\emph{plspec} offers the following descriptions for predicates.
The first argument always refers to the predicate that the spec is written for,
e.g. \verb|my_member/2|.

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        At least one instance of \verb|spec_pre/2|,
        where the second argument describes a valid call of the predicate.
        If the first argument to \verb|my_member/2| can be anything,
        but the second one should be a list (and not a variable),
        it would be \verb|spec_pre(my_member/2, [any, [any]])|.

    \item
        Optionally an instance of \verb|spec_invariant/2|.
        When variables are bound,
        they must still unify with an instance the second argument describes.
        If a spec for \verb|my_member/2| was
        \verb|spec_invariant(member/2, [any, atom])|,
        then it would fail since the first clause
        binds the second argument to a list (of variables).
        Additionally, partial instantiation of variables is supported.
        Consider the spec \verb|[int]|, i.e. a list of integers.
        A variable \verb|_| is valid for this spec.
        When it is bound to, for instance, to a list of variables,
        e.g. \verb|[_, _]|, this value is still valid.
        The lists \verb|[_, 2]|, \verb|[1, _]| as well as \verb|[1, 2]|
        remain valid since they can be unified such that a ground term matches the spec.
        However, \verb|[a, _]| is not valid.

    \item
        Any amount of instances of \verb|spec_post/3|.
        Its second argument describes a spec
        that may or may not be matched when calling the predicate.
        If it was matched, however, the spec contained in the third argument
        has to match after the predicate succeeded (if it succeeds at all).

\end{itemize}
