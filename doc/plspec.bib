  journal    = {Proceedings AFADL},
  abstract   = {The B-method, as well as its offspring Event-B, are both
    tool-supported formal methods used for the development of computer
    systems whose correctness is formally proven. However, the more
    complex the specification becomes, the more proof obligations need to
    be discharged. While many proof obligations can be discharged
    automatically by recent tools such as the Rodin platform, a
    considerable number still have to be proven interactively. This can be
    either because the required proof is too complicated or because the B
    model is erroneous. In this paper we describe a disprover plugin for
    Rodin that utilizes the ProB animator and model checker to
    automatically find counterexamples for a given problematic proof
    obligation. In case the disprover finds a counterexample, the user can
    directly investigate the source of the problem (as pinpointed by the
    counterexample) and should not attempt to prove the proof obligation.
    We also discuss under which circumstances our plug-in can be used as a
    prover, i.e., when the absence of a counterexample actually is a proof
    of the proof obligation.},

    very elegantly in state-based formal methods such as B. However, is B
    suited for developing larger applications and are there existing tools
    that scale for these projects? In this paper, we present our
    experiences on two real-world data validation projects from different
    domains which are based on the B language and use ProB as the central
    validation tool. The first project is the validation of university
    timetables, and the second project is the validation of railway
    topologies. Based on these two projects, we present a general
    structure of a data validation project in B and outline common
    challenges along with various solutions. We also discuss possible
    evolutions of the B language to make it (even) more suitable for such
    projects.},
